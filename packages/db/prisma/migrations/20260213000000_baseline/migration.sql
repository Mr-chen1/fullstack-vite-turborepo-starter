-- CreateTable (baseline migration - tables already exist from MikroORM)
-- This migration marks the baseline state of the database
-- No SQL needs to be executed as tables were created by MikroORM

-- The dummy table structure (for reference):
-- CREATE TABLE "dummy" (
--     "id" UUID NOT NULL,
--     "created_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
--     "updated_at" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
--     CONSTRAINT "dummy_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
-- );

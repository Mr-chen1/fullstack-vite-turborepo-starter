# Lint on Push Only

Do **not** call `ReadLints` after code edits in normal flow. Lint is enforced at commit time via pre-commit (lint-staged).

## When to Use ReadLints

- When the user explicitly asks to check for lint errors.
- When fixing a reported build or lint failure.

## When Not to Use ReadLints

- After routine code edits or feature implementation.
- To "verify" or "check" edits unless the user requested it.

Lint and format run automatically on staged files before commit; no need to run them in-session to save tokens.
